    <br><h3>You search, You hope for the best by the pictures and put down a deposit, get verified wait a couple days and you get it, but then the schedule changes and now we need to apply for another one while putting down another deposit and get verified for that one and repeat the cycle, am I right?
    what if there was an app that verifies you once and keeps your verification on file and making one deposit is all you had to do, as long as the terms and conditions are meant thats all it takes with CrashLanding. We encourage reviews when pictures arenâ€™t enough.
    We verify your employment and the requirements once every 60 days and keep it on file. We collect your deposit with a third party escrow and as long as terms and conditions are met, we transfer your deposit to your next Crash Pad. We make finding a bed as easy as swiping right.
